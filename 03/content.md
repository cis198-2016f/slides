# Generics & Traits

### CIS 198 Lecture 3

## Traits

- Implementing functions on a per-type basis to pretty-print, compute equality,
  etc. is fine, but unstructured.
- We currently have no abstract way to reason about what types can do what!

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn format(&self) -> String {
        format!("({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }

    fn equals(&self, other: Point) -> bool {
        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y
    }
}
```

???

- We have some types, and we can implement functions over those types...
- But that's a little unstructured, if you have to implement simple things (...)
  over each of them

---
## Traits

- Solution: Traits!

---
## Traits

- Define a trait with a `trait` block, which gives function _declarations_ for
  the required methods.
    - (Or default implementations.)

```rust
trait PrettyPrint {
    fn format(&self) -> String;
}
```

---
## Traits

- To implement a trait, use an `impl Trait for Type` block.
    - All methods specified by the trait must be implemented.
- One impl block per type per trait.
- You can use `self`/`Self` inside the trait `impl` block as usual.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl PrettyPrint for Point {
    fn format(&self) -> String {
        format!("({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

impl Equal for Point {
    fn equals(&self, other: Self) -> bool {
        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y
    }
}
```

???

- Simple enough
- More on this in a bit....

---
## Generics

- Suppose we simplify the `Resultish` enum from last week a bit...

```rust
enum Result {
    Ok(String),
    Err(String),
}
```
- Better, but it's still limited to passing two values which are both `String`s.

---
## Generics

- This looks a lot like a standard library enum, `Result<T, E>`:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```
- `T` and `E` stand in for any generic type, not only `String`s.
- You can use any CamelCase identifier for generic types.

---
## Generic Structs

- Let's take a look at generic versions of several other structs from last
    week:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

enum List<T> {
    Nil,
    Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
}
```

---
## Generic Implementations

- Define implementations for structs & enums with generic types by declaring
  generics at the beginning of the `impl` block:

``` rust
impl<T, E> Result<T, E> {
    fn is_ok(&self) -> bool {
        match *self {
            Ok(_) => true,
            Err(_) => false,
        }
    }
}
```

---
## Generic Functions

- You can make a function generic over types as well.
- `<T, U>` declares the type parameters for `foo`.
    - `x: T, y: U` uses those type parameters.
- You can read this as "the function `foo`, for all types `T` and `U`,
    of two arguments: `x` of type `T` and `y` of type `U`."

```rust
fn foo<T, U>(x: T, y: U) {
    // ...
}
```

---
## Trait Bounds

- Instead of allowing _literally any_ type, you can constrain generic types by
    _trait bounds_.
- This gives more power to generic functions & types.
- Trait bounds can be specified with `T: SomeTrait` or with a `where` clause.
    - "where `T` is `Clone`"

```rust
fn cloning_machine<T: Clone>(t: T) -> (T, T) {
    (t.clone(), t.clone())
}

fn cloning_machine_2<T>(t: T) -> (T, T)
        where T: Clone {
    (t.clone(), t.clone())
}
```

---
## Trait Bounds

- Multiple trait bounds are specified like `T: Clone + Ord`.
- There's no way (yet) to specify [negative trait bounds](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-mutually-exclusive-traits/2126).
  - e.g. you can't stipulate that a `T` must not be `Clone`.

```rust
fn clone_and_compare<T: Clone + Ord>(t1: T, t2: T) -> bool {
   t1.clone() > t2.clone()
}
```

---
## Trait Bounds

- Define structs with generic types and trait bounds by...
    - Declaring all generic types in the struct header _and_ the impl block
      header.
    - Only declaring trait bounds in the impl block header.
- Less verbose if you want to have multiple impls for a struct each with
  different trait bounds

---
## Trait Bounds

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
   Ok(T),
   Err(E),
}

trait PrettyPrint {
   fn format(&self) -> String;
}

impl<T: PrettyPrint, E: PrettyPrint> PrettyPrint for Result<T, E> {
   fn format(&self) -> String {
      match *self {
         Ok(t) => format!("Ok({})", t.format()),
         Err(e) => format!("Err({})", e.format()),
      }
   }
}
```

---
## Examples: Equality

```rust
enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E), }

// This is not the trait Rust actually uses for equality
trait Equals {
   fn equals(&self, other: &Self) -> bool;
}

impl<T: Equals, E: Equals> Equals for Result<T, E> {
   fn equals(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
      match (*self, *other) {
         Ok(t1), Ok(t2) => t1.equals(t2),
         Err(e1), Err(e2) => e1.equals(e2),
         _ => false
      }
   }
}
```
- `Self` is a special type which refers to the type of `self`.

---
## Generics in Traits

- You can declare traits with generic types...

```rust
trait Graph<N, E> {
    fn edges(&self, &N) -> Vec<E>;
    // etc
}
```

- `N` and `E` are generic type parameters, but they don't have any meaningful
    association to `Graph`
- Any function that takes a `Graph` must also be generic over `N` and `E`!

```rust
fn distance<N, E, G: Graph<N,E>>(graph: &G, start: &N, end: &N)
    -> u32 { /*...*/ }
```

---
## Associated Types

- Better: associated types!
- `type` definitions inside a trait block indicate associated generic types on
    the trait.
- An implementor of the trait may specify what the associated types correspond
    to.

```rust
trait Graph {
  type N;
  type E;

  fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;
}

impl Graph for MyGraph {
  type N = MyNode;
  type E = MyEdge;

  fn edges(&self, n: &MyNode) -> Vec<MyEdge> { /*...*/ }
}
```

---
## Associated Types

- For example, in the standard library, traits like `Iterator` define an `Item` associated type.
- Methods on the trait like `Iterator::next` then return an `Option<Self::Item>`!
    - This lets you easily specify what type a client gets by iterating over
        your collection.

---
## Iterators

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // More fields omitted
}
```

- A Trait with an associated type, `Item`, and a method `next` which yields that
  type.
- Call `next` repeatedly to get the next item, or `None` if the iterator has
  been exhausted.

---
## Iterators

- Iterators provide syntactic sugar for `for` loops:

```rust
let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for x in values {
    /* loop body */
}
```

---
## Iterators

- Iterators provide syntactic sugar for `for` loops:

```rust
let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
{
    let result = match values.into_iter() {
        mut iter => loop {
            match iter.next() {
                Some(x) => { /* loop body */ },
                None => break,
            }
        },
    };
    result
}
```

- `values.into_iter()` returns a struct that implements `Iterator`.
- `into_iter()` is declared by the trait `IntoIterator`.
    - Automatically implemented by anything with the Trait `Iterator`.

???

- Brace scoping trick
- why let result

---
### Example: Odds

```rust
/// An iterator which counts from one to twenty by twos
struct OddCounter {
    count: usize,
}

impl Iterator for OddCounter {
    type Item = usize;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<usize> {
        if self.count < 20 {
            self.count += 2;
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

---
## Iterators

- Like everything else, there are three types of iteration:
    - `into_iter()`, yielding `T`s.
    ```rust
    for x in values { /* ... */ }
    ```
    - `iter()`, yielding `&T`s.
    ```rust
    for x in &values { /* ... */ }
    ```
    - `iter_mut()`, yielding `&mut T`s.
    ```rust
    for x in &mut values { /* ... */ }
    ```
- A collection may provide some or all of these.

---
## `IntoIterator`

```rust
pub trait IntoIterator where Self::IntoIter::Item == Self::Item {
    type Item;
    type IntoIter: Iterator;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter;
}
```

- `impl IntoIterator for T` should yield an `Iterator` that moves values
    - i.e. same behavior as `t.into_iter()`
- `impl IntoIterator for &T` should yield an `Iterator` that yields references
    - i.e. same behavior as `t.iter()`
- `impl IntoIterator for &mut T` should yield an `Iterator` that yields references
    - i.e. same behavior as `t.iter_mut()`

---
## `IntoIterator`

```rust
impl<I: Iterator> IntoIterator for I
```

- All types that implement `Iterator` automatically implement `IntoIterator`.

---
## Trait Scope

- Say our program defines some trait `Foo`.
- It's possible to implement this trait on any type in Rust, including types that
  you don't own:

```rust
trait Foo {
   fn bar(&self) -> bool;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
    fn bar(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

- But this is really bad practice. Avoid if you can!

---
## Inheritance

- Some traits may require other traits to be implemented first.
    - e.g., `Eq` requires that `PartialEq` be implemented, and `Copy` requires `Clone`.
- Implementing the `Child` trait below requires you to also implement `Parent`.

```rust
trait Parent {
    fn foo(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}

trait Child: Parent {
    fn bar(&self) {
        self.foo();
        // ...
    }
}
```

---
## Default Methods

- Traits can have default implementations for methods!
   - Useful if you have an idea of how an implementor will commonly define a trait method.
- When a default implementation is provided, the implementor of the trait doesn't need to define that method.
- Define default implementations of trait methods by simply writing the body in
    the `trait` block.

```rust
trait PartialEq<Rhs: ?Sized = Self> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;

    fn ne(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool {
        !self.eq(other)
    }
}

trait Eq: PartialEq<Self> {}
```

---
## Default Methods

- Implementors of the trait can overwrite default implementations, but make sure
    you have a good reason to!
    - e.g., _never_ define `ne` so that it violates the relationship between
      `eq` and `ne`.

---
## Trait Scope

- The scope rules for implementing traits:
    - You need to `use` a trait in order to access its methods on types, even if
      you have access to the type.
    - In order to write an `impl`, you need to own (i.e. have yourself defined)
      either the trait or the type.

---
## Deriving

- Many traits are so straightforward that the compiler can often implement them
  for you.
- A `#[derive(...)]` attribute tells the compiler to insert a default
  implementation for whatever traits you tell it to.
- This removes the tedium of repeatedly manually implementing traits like `Clone` yourself!

```rust
#[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
enum Result<T, E> {
   Ok(T),
   Err(E)
}
```

---
## Deriving

- You can only do this for the following core traits:
    - `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Default`, `Eq`,
    - `Hash`, `Ord`, `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`.
- Enabling `derive` on custom traits can be done through compiler plugins.
- Careful: deriving a trait won't always work.
    - Can only derive a trait on a data type when all of its members can have derived the trait.
    - e.g., `Eq` can't be derived on a struct containing only `f32`s, since
      `f32` is not `Eq`.

---
## Core traits

- It's good to be familiar with the core traits.
    - `Clone`, `Copy`
    - `Debug`
    - `Default`
    - `Eq`, `PartialEq`
    - `Hash`
    - `Ord`, `PartialOrd`

---
### Clone

```rust
pub trait Clone: Sized {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;

    fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) { ... }
}
```
- A trait which defines how to duplicate a value of type `T`.
- This can solve ownership problems.
    - You can clone an object rather than taking ownership or borrowing!

---
### Clone

```rust
#[derive(Clone)] // without this, Bar cannot derive Clone.
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Bar {
    x: Foo,
}
```

---
### Copy
```rust
pub trait Copy: Clone { }
```
- `Copy` denotes that a type has "copy semantics" instead of "move semantics."
- Type must be able to be copied by copying bits (`memcpy`).
    - Types that contain references _cannot_ be `Copy`.
- Marker trait: does not implement any methods, but defines behavior instead.
- In general, if a type _can_ be `Copy`, it _should_ be `Copy`.

---
### Debug

```rust
pub trait Debug {
    fn fmt(&self, &mut Formatter) -> Result;
}
```

- Defines output for the `{:?}` formatting option.
- Generates debug output, not pretty printed.
- Generally speaking, you should always derive this trait.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
println!("The origin is: {:?}", origin);
// The origin is: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
```

---
### Default

```rust
pub trait Default: Sized {
    fn default() -> Self;
}
```
- Defines a default value for a type.

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

```rust
pub trait PartialEq<Rhs: ?Sized = Self> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;

    fn ne(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
}

pub trait Eq: PartialEq<Self> {}
```
- Traits for defining equality via the `==` operator.

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

- `PartialEq` represents a _partial equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
- `ne` has a default implementation in terms of `eq`.
- `Eq` represents a _total equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
    - **Reflexive: a == a**
- `Eq` does not define any additional methods.
    - (It is also a Marker trait.)

---
### Hash

```rust
pub trait Hash {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H);

    fn hash_slice<H: Hasher>(data: &[Self], state: &mut H)
        where Self: Sized { ... }
}
```
- A hashable type.
- The `H` type parameter is an abstract hash state used to compute the hash.
- If you also implement `Eq`, there is an additional, important property:
```rust
k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
```

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait PartialOrd<Rhs: ?Sized = Self>: PartialEq<Rhs> {
    // Ordering is one of Less, Equal, Greater
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Rhs) -> Option<Ordering>;

    fn lt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn le(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn gt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn ge(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
}
```
- Traits for values that can be compared for a sort-order.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

- The comparison must satisfy, for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
  - Antisymmetry: if `a < b` then `!(a > b)`, as well as `a > b` implying `!(a < b)`; and
  - Transitivity: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge` have default implementations based on `partial_cmp`.

&sup1;taken from Rustdocs

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd<Self> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;
}
```
- Trait for types that form a total order.
- An order is a total order if it is (for all `a`, `b` and `c`):
  - total and antisymmetric: exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
  - transitive, `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- When this trait is derived, it produces a lexicographic ordering.

&sup1;taken from Rustdocs

---
### Other Traits

- Other standard library important traits that can't be derived.

---
### Display

```rust
pub trait Display {
    fn fmt(&self, &mut Formatter) -> Result<(), Error>;
}

impl Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Point {}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}
```

- Defines output for the `{}` formatting option.
- Like Debug, but should be pretty printed.
    - No standard output and cannot be derived!
- You can use `write!` macro to implement this without using Formatter.

---
## Drop

```rust
pub trait Drop {
    fn drop(&mut self);
}
```

- A trait for types that are destructable (which is all types).
- `Drop` requires one method, `drop`, but you should never call this method yourself.
    - It's inserted automatically by the compiler when necessary.

---
## Drop

- Typically, you won't actually implement `Drop` for a type
    - Generally the default implementation is fine.
    - You also don't need to `derive` `Drop` either.
- Why implement `Drop` then?
    - If you need some special behavior when an object gets destructed.

---
## Drop

- Example: Rust's reference-counted pointer type `Rc<T>` has special `Drop` rules:
    - If the number of references to an `Rc` pointer is greater than 1, `drop` decrements the ref count.
    - The `Rc` is actually deleted when the reference count drops to 0.

---
## `Sized` vs. `?Sized`

- `Sized` indicates that a type has a constant size known at compile time!
- Its evil twin, `?Sized`, indicates that a type _might_ be sized.
- By default, all types are implicitly `Sized`, and `?Sized` undoes this.
    - Types like `[T]` and `str` (no `&`) are `?Sized`.
- For example, `Box<T>` allows `T: ?Sized`.
- You rarely interact with these traits directly, but they show up a lot in trait bounds.

---
## Trait Objects

- Consider the following trait, and its implementors:

```rust
trait Foo { fn bar(&self); }

impl Foo for String {
    fn bar(&self) { /*...*/ }
}

impl Foo for usize {
    fn bar(&self) { /*...*/  }
}
```

---
## Trait Objects

- We can call either of these versions of `bar` via static dispatch using any type with bounds `T: Foo`.
- When this code is compiled, the compiler will insert calls to specialized versions of `bar`
    - One function is generated for each implementor of the `Foo` trait.

```rust
fn blah(x: T) where T: Foo {
    x.bar()
}

fn main() {
    let s = "Foo".to_string();
    let u = 12;

    blah(s);
    blah(u);
}
```

---
## Trait Objects

- It is also possible to have Rust perform _dynamic_ dispatch through the use of *trait objects*.
- A trait object is something like `Box<Foo>` or `&Foo`
- The data behind the reference/box must implement the trait `Foo`.
- The concrete type underlying the trait is erased; it can't be determined.

---
## Trait Objects

```rust
trait Foo { /*...*/ }

impl Foo for char { /*...*/ }
impl Foo for i32  { /*...*/ }

fn use_foo(f: &Foo) {
    // No way to figure out if we got a `char` or an `i32`
    // or anything else!
    match *f {
        // What type do we have? I dunno...
        // error: mismatched types: expected `Foo`, found `_`
        198 => println!("CIS 198!"),
        'c' => println!("See?"),
        _ => println!("Something else..."),
    }
}

use_foo(&'c'); // These coerce into `&Foo`s
use_foo(&198i32);
```

---
## Trait Objects

- When a trait object is used, method dispatch must be performed at runtime.
    - The compiler can't know the type underlying the trait reference, since it was erased.
- This causes a runtime penalty, but is useful when handling things like dynamically sized types.

---
## Object Safety

- Not all traits can be safely used in trait objects!
- Trying to create a variable of type `&Clone` will cause a compiler error, as `Clone` is not _object safe_.
- A trait is object-safe if:
    - It does not require that `Self: Sized`
    - Its methods must not use `Self`
    - Its methods must not have any type parameters
    - Its methods do not require that `Self: Sized`
