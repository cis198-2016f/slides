## String Types

- Rust strings are complicated.
    - Sequences of Unicode values encoded in UTF-8.
    - Not null-terminated and may contain null bytes.
- There are two kinds: `&str` and `String`.

---
## `&str`

- `&str` is a string slice (like array slice).
- `"string literals"` are of type `&str`.&sup1;
- `&str`s are statically-allocated and fixed-size.
- May not be indexed with `some_str[i]`, as each character may be multiple bytes
    due to Unicode.
- Instead, iterate with `chars()`:
    - `for c in "1234".chars() { ... }`
- As with all Rust references, they have an associated lifetime.

&sup1;More specifically, they have the type `&'static str`.

---
## `String`

```rust
#[derive(PartialOrd, Eq, Ord)]
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
pub struct String {
    vec: Vec<u8>,
}
```
- `String`s are heap-allocated, and are dynamically growable.
- Cannot be indexed either.
    - You can select characters with `s.nth(i)`.
- May be coerced into an `&str` by taking a reference to the `String`.

```rust
let s0: String = String::new();
let s1: String = "foo".to_string();
let s2: String = String::from("bar");
let and_s: &str = &s0;
```

???

Heap-allocated and growable like Vecs, because they _are_ Vecs

---
## `str`

- If `&str` is the second string type, what exactly is `str`?
- An `Unsized` type, meaning the size is unknown at compile time.
    - You can't have bindings to `str`s directly, only references.

---
## String Concatenation

- A `String` and an `&str` may be concatenated with `+`:

```rust
let course_code = "CIS".to_string();
let course_name = course_code + " 198";
```

- Concatenating two `String`s requires coercing one to `&str`:

```rust
let course_code = String::from("CIS");
let course_num  = String::from(" 198");
let course_name = course_code + &course_num;
```

- You can't concatenate two `&str`s.

```rust
let course_name = "CIS " + "198"; // Err!
```

---
## `String` & `&str`: Why?

- Like slices for `Vec`s, `&str`s are useful for passing a view into a `String`.
- It's expensive to copy a `String` around, and lending an entire `String` out
    may be overkill.
- `&str` therefore allows you to pass portions of a `String` around, saving
    memory.

---
## `String` & `&str`: Why?

- Generally, start with `String` unless you have string literals.
    - You can then lend out `&str`s easily.
- i.e. Building a `String` via concatenation or formatting, then pass it as a
  function argument.

---
## String Conversion

- However, *actually* converting a `String` into an `&str` requires a
  dereference:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;

TcpStream::connect("192.168.0.1:3000"); // &str
let addr = "192.168.0.1:3000".to_string();
TcpStream::connect(&*addr);
```

- This doesn't automatically coerce because `TcpStream` doesn't take an argument
  of type `&str`, but a Trait bounded type:
    - `TcpStream::connect<A: ToSocketAddr>(addr: A);`

---
## `Deref` Coercions

- We know Rust can automatically dereference from `&T` to `T`.
- This can support dereferencing between _different_ types too.

```rust
pub trait Deref {
    type Target: ?Sized;
    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target;
}
```
- Since `String` implements `Deref<Target=str>`, so values of `&String` will
  automatically be dereferenced to `&str` when possible.

---
## Operators

- Operators are evaluated left-to-right, in the following order:
    - Unary operators: `!` `-` `*` `&` `&mut`
    - `as` casting
    - `*` `/` `%` multiplicative arithmetic
    - `+` `-` additive arithmetic
    - `<<` `>>` shift arithmetic
    - `&` bitwise and
    - `^` bitwise xor
    - `|` bitwise or
    - `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` logical comparison
    - `&&` logical and
    - `||` logical or
    - `=` `..` assignment and ranges
- Also: `call()`, `index[]`

---
## Operator Overloading

- Okay, same old, same old. We can customize these!
- Rust defines these - surprise! - using traits, in `std::ops`.
    - `Neg`, `Not`, `Deref`, `DerefMut`
    - `Mul`, `Div`, `Mod`
    - `Add`, `Sub`
    - `Shl`, `Shr`
    - `BitAnd`
    - `BitXor`
    - `BitOr`
    - `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`
    - `And`
    - `Or`
- Also: `Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`, `Index`, `IndexMut`, `Drop`

---
## `Option<T>`

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

- Provides a concrete type to the concept of _nothingness_.
- Use this instead of returning `NaN`, `-1`, `null`, etc. from a function.
- No restrictions on what `T` may be.

---
### `Option::unwrap()`

- The pattern where None values are ignored is pretty common:

```rust
// fn foo() -> Option<i32>

match foo() {
    None => None,
    Some(value) => {
        bar(value)
        // ...
    },
}
```

---
### `Option::unwrap()`

- What if we extracted the pattern match into a separate function to simplify it?

```rust
fn unwrap<T>(&self) -> T { // 🎁!
    match *self {
        None => panic!("Called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value"),
        Some(value) => value,
    }
}

let x = foo().unwrap();
let y = bar(x);
// ...
```

- Unfortunately, `panic!`ing on `None` values makes this abstraction inflexible.
- Better: use `expect(&self, msg: String) -> T` instead.
    - `panic!`s with a custom error message if a `None` value is found.

---
### `Option::map()`

- Let's make the pattern a little better.
- We'll take an `Option`, change the value if it exists, and return an `Option`.
    - Instead of failing on `None`, we'll keep it as `None`.

```rust
fn map<U, F>(self, f: F) -> Option<U>
        where F: FnOnce(T) -> U {
    match self {
        None => None,
        Some(x) => Some(f(x))
    }
}

// fn foo() -> Option<i32>

let x = foo().map(|x| bar(x));
```

---
### `Option::and_then()`

- There's a similar function `and_then`:

```rust
fn and_then<U, F>(self, f: F) -> Option<U>
      where F: FnOnce(T) -> Option<U> {
    match self {
        Some(x) => f(x),
        None => None,
    }
}

// fn foo() -> Option<i32>

let x = foo().and_then(|x| Some(bar(x)));
```

- Notice the type of `f` changes from `T -> U` to `T -> Some(U)`.

---
### `Option::unwrap_or()`

- If we don't want to operate on an `Option` value, but it has a sensible
  default value, there's `unwrap_or`.

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn unwrap_or<T>(&self, default: T) -> T {
      match *self {
          None => default,
          Some(value) => value,
      }
    }
}
```

---
### `Option::unwrap_or_else()`

- If you don't have a static default value, but you can write a closure to
  compute one:

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn unwrap_or_else<T>(&self, f: F) -> T
            where F: FnOnce() -> T {
        match *self {
            None => f(),
            Some(value) => value,
        }
    }
}
```

---
### Other

- Some other methods provided by Option:
- `fn is_some(&self) -> bool`
- `fn is_none(&self) -> bool`
- `fn map_or<U, F>(self, default: U, f: F) -> U`
    - `where F: FnOnce(T) -> U`
    - A default value`: U`.
- `fn map_or_else<U, D, F>(self, default: D, f: F) -> U`
    - `where D: FnOnce() -> U, F: FnOnce(T) -> U`
    - A default-generating closure`: D`.

---
### Other

- `fn ok_or(self, err: E) -> Result<T, E>`
- `fn ok_or_else(self, default: F) -> Result<T, E>`
    - `where F: FnOnce() -> E`
    - Similar to `unwrap_or` but returns a `Result` with a default `Err` or closure.
- `fn and<U>(self, optb: Option<U>) -> Option<U>`
    - Returns `None` if `self` is `None`, else `optb`
- `fn or(self, optb: Option<T>) -> Option<T>`
    - returns `self` if `self` is `Some(_)`, else `optb`

---
## Result<T, E>

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}
```

- `Result` is like `Option`, but it also encodes an `Err` type.
- Also defines `unwrap()` and `expect()` methods.
- Can be converted to an `Option` using `ok()` or `err()`.
    - Takes either `Ok` or `Err` and discards the other as `None`.
- Can be operated on in almost all the same ways as `Option`
    - `and`, `or`, `unwrap`, etc.

---
## Result<T, E>

- Unlike `Option`, a `Result` should _always_ be consumed.
    - If a function returns a `Result`, you should be sure to `unwrap`/`expect`
        it, or otherwise handle the `Ok`/`Err` in a meaningful way.
    - The compiler warns you if you don't.
    - Not using a result could result (ha) in your program unintentionally
        crashing!

---
### Custom Result Aliases

- A common pattern is to define a type alias for Result which uses your libary's
  custom Error type.

```rust
use std::io::Error;

type Result<T> = Result<T, Error>;
```

- Typically a convenience alias; other than fixing `E = Error`, this is
  identical to `std::Result`.
- Users of this type should namespace it:

```rust
use std::io;

fn foo() -> io::Result {
    // ...
}
```

---
## `try!`

- `try!` is a macro, which means it generates Rust's code at compile-time.
    - This means it can actually expand to pattern matching syntax patterns.
- The code that `try!` generates looks roughly like this:

```rust
macro_rules! try {
    ($e:expr) => (match $e {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(err) => return Err(err),
    });
}

try!(Ok(42));

match Ok(42) {
    Ok(val) => val,
    Err(err) => return Err(err);
}
```

---
## `try!`

- `try!` is a concise way to implement early returns when encountering errors.

```rust
let socket1: TcpStream = try!(TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8000"));

// Is equivalent to...
let maybe_socket: Result<TcpStream> =
    TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8000");
let socket2: TcpStream =
    match maybe_socket {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(err) => { return Err(err) }
    };
```

- This is actually a _slight_ simplification.
    - Actual `try!` has some associated trait ~~magic~~logic.
- You can only call `try!` in a function that returns a `Result`.

---
## [Collections](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/)

---
## `Vec<T>`

- Nothing new here.

---
## `VecDeque<T>`

- An efficient double-ended `Vec`.
- Implemented as a ring buffer.

---
## `LinkedList<T>`

- A doubly-linked list.
- Even if you want this, you probably don't want this.
    - Seriously, did you even read *any* of Gankro's book?

---
## `HashMap<K,V>`/`BTreeMap<K,V>`

- Map/dictionary types.
- `HashMap<K, V>` is useful when you want a basic map.
    - Requires that `K: Hash + Eq`.
    - Uses "linear probing with Robin Hood bucket stealing".
- `BTreeMap<K, V>` is a sorted map (with different performance benefits).
    - Requires that `K: Ord`.
    - Uses a B-tree under the hood (surprise surprise).

---
## `HashSet<T>`/`BTreeSet<T>`

- Sets for storing unique values.
- `HashSet<T>` and `BTreeSet<T>` are literally struct wrappers for `HashMap<T, ()>` and `BTreeMap<T, ()>`.
- Same tradeoffs and requirements as their Map variants.

---
## `BinaryHeap<T>`

- A priority queue implemented with a binary max-heap.

---
## Iterator

- Iterators are types which provide `fn next() -> Option<T>`.
- Yields `Some(val)` until the end of the iterator (if it exists), then `None`.

---
## Iterator Consumers

- Consumers operate on an iterator and return one or more values.
- There are like a billion of these, so let's look at a few.

---
## `collect`

- `collect()` rolls a (lazy) iterator back into an actual collection.
- The target collection must define the `FromIterator` trait for the `Item`
  inside the `Iterator`.
- `collect()` sometimes needs a type hint to properly compile.
    - The output type can be practically any collection.

```rust
fn collect<B>(self) -> B where B: FromIterator<Self::Item>

let vs = vec![1,2,3,4];
// What type is this?
let set = vs.iter().collect();
// Hint to `collect` that we want a HashSet back.
// Note the lack of an explicit <i32>.
let set: HashSet<_> = vs.iter().collect();
// Alternate syntax! The "turbofish" ::<>
let set = vs.iter().collect::<HashSet<_>>();
```

---
## `fold`

```rust
fn fold<B, F>(self, init: B, f: F) -> B
    where F: FnMut(B, Self::Item) -> B;

let vs = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
let sum = vs.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
assert_eq!(sum, 15);
```

- `fold` "folds up" an iterator into a single value.
    - Sometimes called `reduce` or `inject` in other languages.
- `fold` takes two arguments:
    - An initial value or "accumulator" (`acc` above) of type `B`.
    - A function that takes a `B` and the type inside the iterator (`Item`) and
        returns a `B`.
- Rust doesn't do tail-recursion (yet), so `fold` is implemented iteratively.
    - [See here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/217) for more info.

---
## `filter`

```rust
fn filter<P>(self, predicate: P) -> Filter<Self, P>
    where P: FnMut(&Self::Item) -> bool;
```

- `filter` takes a predicate function `P` and removes anything that doesn't pass
    the predicate.
- `filter` returns a `Filter<Self, P>`, so you need to `collect` it to get a new
    collection.

---
## `skip`

```rust
fn skip(self, n: usize) -> Skip<Self>;
```
- Creates an iterator that skips its first `n` elements.

---
## `zip`

```rust
fn zip<U>(self, other: U) -> Zip<Self, U::IntoIter>
    where U: IntoIterator;
```

- Takes two iterators and zips them into a single iterator.
- Invoked like `a.iter().zip(b.iter())`.
    - Returns pairs of items like `(ai, bi)`.
- The shorter iterator of the two wins for stopping iteration.

---
## `any` & `all`

```rust
fn any<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> bool
    where F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> bool;

fn all<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> bool
    where F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> bool;
```

- `any` tests if any element in the iterator matches the input function
- `all` tests all elements in the iterator match the input function
- Logical OR vs. logical AND.

---
## `enumerate`

```rust
fn enumerate(self) -> Enumerate<Self>;
```

- Want to iterate over a collection by item and index?
- Use `enumerate`!
- This iterator returns `(index, value)` pairs.
    - `index` is the `usize` index of `value` in the collection.

---
## Iterator Adapters

- Adapters operate on an iterator and return a new iterator.
- Adapters are often _lazy_  -- they don't evaluate unless you force them to!
- You must explicitly call some iterator consumer on an adapter or use it in a
    `for` loop to cause it to evaluate.

---
## `map`

```rust
fn map<B, F>(self, f: F) -> Map<Self, F>
    where F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> B;

let vs = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
let twice_vs: Vec<_> = vs.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
```

- `map` takes a function and creates an iterator that calls the function on each
    element
- Abstractly, it takes a `Collection<A>` and a function of `A -> B` and
    returns a `Collection<B>`
    - (`Collection` is not a real type)

---
## `take` & `take_while`

```rust
fn take(self, n: usize) -> Take<Self>;

fn take_while<P>(self, predicate: P) -> TakeWhile<Self, P>
    where P: FnMut(&Self::Item) -> bool;
```

- `take` creates an iterator that yields its first `n` elements.
- `take_while` takes a closure as an argument, and iterates until the closure
    returns `false`.
- Can be used on infinite ranges to produce finite enumerations:

```rust
for i in (0..).take(5) {
    println!("{}", i); // Prints 0 1 2 3 4
}
```

---
## `cloned`

```rust
fn cloned<'a, T>(self) -> Cloned<Self>
    where T: 'a + Clone, Self: Iterator<Item=&'a T>;
```

- Creates an iterator which calls `clone` on all of its elements.
- Abstracts the common pattern `vs.iter().map(|v| v.clone())`.
- Useful when you have an iterator over `&T`, but need one over `T`.

---
## `drain`

- Not actually an `Iterator` method, but is very similar.
- Calling `drain()` on a collection removes and returns some or all elements.
- e.g. `Vec::drain(&mut self, range: R)` removes and returns a range out of a vector.

---
## Iterators

- There are many more `Iterator` methods we didn't cover.
- Take a look at [the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) for the rest.
